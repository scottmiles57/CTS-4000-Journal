## **Abstract:**
*Going Beyond The Intended* is a creative digital storytelling project done using a software program called **Twine**. This is a choose-your-own-pathway story in which you select
1 of 2 characters (Dave or Helen Choat) to give you a tour of a barn on their property in Rural Ontario. After taking both tours of the barn, you can contrast the 2 separate
perspectives of the barn and its role in their rural lifestyle, to see how the appreciation, utility, and purpose of one barn differ between 2 people.

Communication, style, and polish (/5): Is the written content clear and concise, with a logical flow? Does the author have an engaging writing style, which grabs the reader's attention? Are there any grammar or spelling errors?​
The style of this project is well done! The writing flow is easy to follow and engaging. Language is descriptive yet does a great job of guiding the reader through the story of the Choat Family and their bank-style barn in an easy-to-follow tone. Pages of the Twine are well set up. I would suggest reading it a couple of times more after adding content to the empty pages, and also reviewing sections such as this one, which has some spelling errors. Keep an eye out for run-on sentences, but overall, well done! The structuring of text breaks and paragraphs is logical and sections the story well.




In this example, bbarncase should be barn case, and “the structure are founded” should be found.




Relevance to special issue theme (/5): Is the submission a good fit for the journal? For authors who are submitting to CTRL+ALT+DH, does it relate strongly to the issue theme of creativity in digital spaces, or is it only loosely connected? Are there other ways that their work connects, which could be further explored? Do you know of any articles or other sources, which might be helpful tothe author? See: CTRL+ALT+DH Call for Papers.​


I would say that the submission is a good fit for the journal as it explores a creative interpretation of a barn tour, and understanding personal testimony and the value of a barn's connection to people and the rural lifestyle. It is important to explore stories like this through a creative lens, in this case, an interview made into a storytelling game, where you choose how you navigate it and in a refreshing format that calls readers to think about what connects people through the lens of barns. I think it would benefit from filling out the empty pages in the twine to add more detail, as well as adding a section to tie things together as a conclusion. Maybe mentioning further how creative interpretations of stories through a digital format are important/ how creative formats like this better inform visitors. This could take the form of a reflection in the conclusion/ be apart of your introduction, or a separate path where you describe the thoughts behind the project in more depth.

Overall originality, creativity, and strength of ideas (/5): Are the ideas unique and compelling? Does the author offer an original point-of-view?​
This is a very original story as it takes a dive into the personal accounts of a barn-owning family. The path this project travels is unique and an interesting take on what creativity looks like in the recounting of community perspectives and values. The author's point of view is compelling and a great demonstration of preserving conversations on a barn's importance to a family in rural Ontario.


Accuracy and completion of Markdown code (/5): Does the Markdown file include metadata, with the title, date, issue, author, citation, tags, abstract, and bio, etc (see below)? Are the headings properly formatted? Do the links work? Are the images properly sized? If there are citations, are they properly encoded? For an example of how to format metadata and footnotes, check out the CTRL+ALT+DH Issue 2 article, "Writing Against Erasure" (raw Markdown Code vs final published article). See also: Markdown Guide.


Yes, the markdown file includes metadata in a proper format that outlines the project and defines it properly. The links work properly.


One note I'd like to make about images within the Twine story is that most do not appear and are invalid.
